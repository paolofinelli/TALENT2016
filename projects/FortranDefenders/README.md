## Coding for Hono(u)r and Justice


Welcome to our home in the Repo.

Of particular interest right now is the Hartree-Fock solver in the Hartree-Fock folder.
In the **in** file, you will set the parameters for your HF run. For easy use,
try the *run* script to clean, compile, run, and output the **out** file.

To see a full set of documentation, visit [here!](http://fortrandefenders.kylegodbey.com)

Once you compile and run the code, you'll find the **single particle states**,
**total and kinetic energies**, and **convergence at each iteration** in the file named **out**.

Densities are plotted in the file **densities**, with the order of the columns being *Neutrons, Protons, Total*.

Run the density.gpl Gnuplot script to export *density.eps* which plots the neutron (left)
and proton (right) densities.

***Have Fun!***
